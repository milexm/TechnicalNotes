## 1. GitHub Desktop

![github_icon](..\Resources\Images\GitHub\github_icon.jpg) Focus on what matters
instead of fighting with Git. Whether you're new to Git or a seasoned user,
GitHub Desktop simplifies your development workflow. You can download the
desktop app at this location: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). 

See [README](../GitHub/README.md).  

## 2. Visual Studio Code

This folder contains information about the **Visual Studio Code** tool.  Visual
Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that runs on your
desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in
support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of
extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, and .NET). 

See [README](./Visual%20Studio%20Code/README.md).
