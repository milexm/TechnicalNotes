## 1. GitHub getting started

You use Git to manage your repositories, . We reccomend you use the GitHub desktop client. Install the GitHub GUI client from this location: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This tool provides a very friendly GUI and seamless integration with your GitHub repositories. So, go for it!! 
For more information, see [GitHub Desktop Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/desktop).

Alternatively, you can install the Git command line tool, refer to [Getting Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). But it has a steep learning curve. See also [Git](git.md). 

### 1.1. Create a local Git repository 

1. Activate the Git client.
1. From the **File** drop-down menu, select **New Repository**

    ![create new repository](../Resources/Images/GitHub/create_new_repository.png)

1. In the popup dialog window enter the required information.
