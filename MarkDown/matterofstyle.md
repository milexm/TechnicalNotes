### Capitalization

Microsoft style uses sentence-style capitalization. That means
everything is lowercase except the first word and proper nouns, which
include the names of brands, products, and services. (Microsoft has more
than 500 offerings. To help customers recognize, find, and buy them,
reserve capitalization for product and service names.)
