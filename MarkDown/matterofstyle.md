## 1. Microsoft writing style guide

Make every word matter. Welcome to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide,
your guide to writing style and terminology for all
communicationâ€”whether an app, a website, or a white paper. If you write
about computer technology, this guide is for you.

For more informationm, see [Microsoft writing style guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).


### 1.1. Capitalization

Microsoft style uses sentence-style capitalization. That means
everything is lowercase except the first word and proper nouns, which
include the names of brands, products, and services. (Microsoft has more
than 500 offerings. To help customers recognize, find, and buy them,
reserve capitalization for product and service names.)

For more information, see [Capitalization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/capitalization).

## 2. Markdown custom styles

The technique shown in this section works on your local machine, 'cause the style [custom.css](../Css/custom.css) file is local. It does not work if you publish the file on a public server such as GitHub. See examples of custome styles in the [custom.css](../Css/custom.css) file.
