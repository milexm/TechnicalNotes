    "These are notes about Deep Learning. Here you find information about hands-on artificial neural networks  as it applies to artificial intelligence (AI). Some of the information is liberaly adapted from the following sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/)\n",
    "- [What is deep learning? Everything you need to know](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-deep-learning-everything-you-need-to-know/) \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "**Deep learning** is a **subset of machine learning**, which falls **within the field of artificial intelligence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "<div class=\"warning\">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the study of how to build machines capable of carrying out tasks that would typically require human intelligence.</div> It encompasses many fields of research, from genetic algorithms to expert systems, and provides scope for arguments over what constitutes AI.\n",
    "Within the field of AI research, machine learning has enjoyed remarkable success in recent years, allowing computers to surpass or come close to matching human performance in areas ranging from facial recognition to speech and language recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning\n",
    "<div class=\"warning\">Machine learning is the process of teaching a computer to perform a task, rather than programming it to perform that task step by step.</div>\n",
    "   \n",
    "At the end of the training phase, a machine-learning system will be able to make accurate predictions when given data. Those predictions could be answering whether a piece of fruit in a photo is a banana or an apple, if a person is crossing in front of a self-driving car, whether the use of the word book in a sentence relates to a paperback or a hotel reservation, whether an email is spam, or recognizing speech accurately enough to generate captions for a YouTube video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is typically divided into the following 2 areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning**. Where the computer learns by example from labeled data.\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**. Where the computer groups similar data and pinpoints anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Learning\n",
    "<div class=\"warning\">Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, whose capabilities differ in several key respects from traditional shallow machine learning, allowing computers to solve a host of complex problems that couldn't otherwise be tackled.</div> \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a simple, shallow machine-learning task might be predicting how ice-cream sales will vary based on outdoor temperature. Making predictions using only a couple of data features in this way is relatively straightforward, and can be carried out using a shallow machine-learning technique called linear regression with gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "But many problems in the real world aren't a good fit for such simple models. An example of one of these real-world problems is recognizing handwritten numbers. In this case, the computer must handle a huge variety in how the data can be presented. Every digit between 0 and 9 can be written in many different ways: the size and exact shape of each handwritten digit can be very different depending on who's writing and in what circumstance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"info\">Coping with the variability of these features, and the even bigger complexity of interactions between them, is where <b>deep learning</b> and <b>deep neural networks</b> become useful.</div>\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Neural Network  \n",
    "<div class=\"warning\">Neural networks are mathematical models whose structure is loosely inspired by that of the brain.</div> \n",
    "Each neuron within a neural network is a mathematical function that takes in data via an input, transforms that data into a more usable form, and then produce an output. <div class=\"warning\">You can think of neurons in a neural network as being arranged in layers, as shown below.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "![neural_network](../../Images/DeepLearning/neural_network.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All neural networks have an **input layer**, where the initial data is entered, and an **output layer**, that generates the **final prediction**. \n",
    "In a deep neural network, there will be multiple **hidden layers** of neurons between these input and output layers, each feeding data into each other. \n",
    "<div class=\"info\">Hence the adjective **deep** as in \"deep learning\" and \"deep neural networks\". It refers to the large number of hidden layers, typically greater than three, at the heart of these neural networks.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplified diagram above hopefully helps to provide an idea of how a simple neural network is structured. In this example, the network has been trained to recognize handwritten figures, such as the number 2 shown here, with the input layer being fed values representing the pixels that make up an image of a handwritten digit, and the output layer predicting which handwritten number was shown in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous picture, each circle represents a neuron in the network, with the neurons organized into vertical layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, each neuron is linked to every neuron in the following layer, representing the fact that each neuron outputs a value into every neuron in the subsequent layer. \n",
    "The color of the links in the diagram also vary. The different colors, black and red, represent the significance of the links between neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The red links are those of greater significance, meaning they will amplify the value as it passes between the layers. \n",
    "- In turn, this amplification of the value can help activate the neuron that the value is being fed into.\n",
    "- A neuron <span style=\"background-color: #ffffcc;\">is activated when the sum of the values being input into this neuron passes a set threshold<span>. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the picture, the activated neurons are shaded red. What this activation means differs according to the layer. In \"Hidden layer 1\" shown in the diagram, an activated neuron might mean the image of the handwritten figure contains a certain combination of pixels that resemble the horizontal line at the top of a handwritten number 7. In this way, \"Hidden layer 1\" could detect many of the tell-tale lines and curves that will eventually combine together into the full handwritten figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning \n",
    "The question to ask is: how these multiple hidden layers allow a computer to defifer a handwritten digit? \n",
    "<div  class=\"info\">These multiple layers of neurons basically provide a way for the neural network to build a rough hierarchy of different features that make up the handwritten digit in question.</div> \n",
    "For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the input is an array of values representing the individual pixels in the image of the handwritten figure. \n",
    "- The next layer might combine these pixels into lines and shapes.\n",
    "- The next layer combines those shapes into distinct features like the loops in an 8 or upper triangle in a 4, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "By building a picture of which of these features, modern neural networks can determine, with a very high level of accuracy, the number that corresponds to a handwritten digit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, different types of deep neural networks can be trained to recognize faces in an image or to transcribe written speech from audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div  class=\"danger\">The process of building this increasingly complex hierarchy of features of the handwritten number out of nothing but pixels is learned by the network. <b>The learning process is made possible by how the network is able to alter the importance of the links between the neurons in each layer.</b> Each link has an <b>attached value called a weight</b>, which will modify the value output by a neuron as it passes from one layer to the next. By altering the value of these weights, and an associated value called <b>bias</b>, it is possible to emphasize or diminish the importance of links between neurons in the network.</div>\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Training\n",
    "<div  class=\"warning\">The model learns which links between neurons are important in making successful predictions during training.</div>  At each step during training, the network will use a mathematical function to determine how accurate its latest prediction was compared to what was expected. This function generates a series of error values, which in turn can be used by the system to calculate how the model should update the value of the weights attached to each link, with the ultimate aim of improving the accuracy of the network's predictions. The extent to which these values should be changed is calculated by an optimization function, such as gradient descent, and those changes are pushed back throughout the network at the end of each training cycle in a step called back propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of many, many training cycles, and with the help of occasional manual parameter tuning, the network will continue to generate better and better predictions until it hits close to peak accuracy. At this point, for example, when handwritten digits could be recognized with more than 95% accuracy, the deep-learning model can be said to have been trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, deep learning allows machine learning to tackle a whole host of new complex problems, such as image, language and speech recognition, by allowing machines to learn how features in the data combine into increasingly higher level, abstract forms. For example in facial recognition, how pixels in an image create lines and shapes, how those lines and shapes create facial features and how these facial features are arranged into a face.\n",
    "\n",
